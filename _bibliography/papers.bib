    abstract = "Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal translation of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention should be paid to this linguistic property in order to generate accurate translation. However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50-mmt models with our dataset for the English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as Spanish-Chinese.",

  journal={CEUR Proceedings CLEF},
  abstract={We present the CLiC group's participation in the EXIST 2025 shared task, focusing on sexism detection in social media content. Our work addresses three subtasks: sexism identification (Task 1.1), source intention detection (Task 1.2), and sexism categorization (Task 1.3). We employed BERT~\cite{devlin2019bert} fine-tuning for Task 1.1 (binary sexism classification) and DSPy-based prompt optimization for Tasks 1.2 and 1.3, leveraging the initial classification outcomes. A key aspect of our approach is a Learning with Disagreement framework that utilizes annotator demographic information to model diverse perceptions of sexism. Our experimental design included three runs, exploring BERT-based methods for Task 1.1 and contrasting prompt-based methods, including variants with annotator information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), for the subsequent tasks. Results demonstrate that BERT fine-tuning significantly surpassed prompt-based methods for Task 1.1, where our approach secured 9th place out of 67 participants in the soft label category. The integration of annotator information proved vital, leading to substantial performance gains across all tasks. The impact of RAG, however, remained inconclusive. These findings highlight the enduring effectiveness of fine-tuned models for core classification, while emphasizing the necessity of annotator-aware approaches for handling subjective concepts like sexism.},

  abstract  = {Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to relationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of  11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contribution of textual and multimodal labels in the classification of sexist and non-sexist content; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.},

For subtask 2, participants had to decide which texts labeled with stereotypes were implicit stereotypes. The DETESTS-Dis dataset contains 12,111 comment sentences and tweets in response to newspaper articles and verified racial hoaxes involving immigration in Spanish. 15 teams signed up to participate, 6 of which sent runs, and 3 of them sent their working notes. In this paper, we provide information about the training and test datasets, the systems used by the participants, the evaluation metrics of the systems and their results.},

  journal={CEUR Proceedings SEPLN},
  abstract={Conversational context plays a pivotal role in disambiguating messages in human communication. In this study, we investigate the impact of contextual information on detecting stereotypes related to immigrants using various BERT-based models. We use two Spanish corpora containing news comments and tweets, together with their conversational threads, annotated with stereotypes related to immigrants in Spain. The results show that the influence of context on stereotype detection varies across different models, corpora and context levels. Although context can enhance performance in specific scenarios, it does not consistently improve stereotype detection across all the levels of contexts. Our comprehensive evaluation underscores the complex relationship between context and stereotype identification when we use BERT-based Language Models. In particular, we found that the number of texts benefiting from contextual analysis may be too limited for the models to effectively learn from.},

		The increasing popularity of natural language processing has led to a race to
		improve machine learning models that often leaves aside the core study
		object, the language itself. In this study, we present classification models
		designed to detect stereotypes related to immigrants, along with both
		quantitative and qualitative analyses, shedding light on linguistic
		distinctions in how humans and various models perceive stereotypes. Given the
		subjective nature of this task, one of the models incorporates the judgments
		of all annotators by utilizing soft labels. Through a comparative analysis of
		BERT-based models using both hard and soft labels, along with predictions
		from GPT-4, we gain a clearer understanding of the linguistic challenges
		posed by texts containing stereotypes. Our dataset comprises Spanish Twitter
		posts collected as responses to immigrant-related hoaxes, annotated with
		binary values indicating the presence of stereotypes, implicitness, and the
		requirement for conversational context to understand the stereotype. Our
		findings suggest that both model prediction confidence and inter-annotator
		agreement are higher for explicit stereotypes, while stereotypes conveyed
		through irony and other figures of speech prove more challenging to detect
		than other implicit stereotypes.

		Alfvénic activity has been observed in the TJ-II stellarator which resembles

		experiments, coil current was varied which resulted in shifting of the
		minimum value of the rotational transform profile. To mimic this effect, we
		study the Alfvénic activity predicted by the reduced MHD model for a set of
		input rotational transform profiles with varying minima. A mode is found
		whose toroidal and poloidal mode numbers match those predicted in experiments
		which sweeps downward/upward in frequency as the minimum value of the
		rotational transform profile is increased/decreased. The results serve as a
		demonstration of the validity and utility of MHD spectroscopy.

		Many epidemiological models and algorithms are used to fit the parameters of
		a given epidemic curve. On many occasions, fitting algorithms are interleaved
		with the actual epidemic models, which yields combinations of
		model-parameters that are hard to compare among themselves. Here, we provide
		a model-agnostic framework for epidemic parameter fitting that can (fairly)
		compare different epidemic models without jeopardizing the quality of the
		fitted parameters. Briefly, we have developed a Python framework that expects
		a Python function (epidemic model) and epidemic data and performs parameter
		fitting using automatic configuration. Our framework is capable of fitting
		parameters for any type of epidemic model, as long as it is provided as a
		Python function (or even in a different programming language). Moreover, we
		provide the code for different types of models, as well as the implementation
		of 4 concrete models with data to fit them. Documentation, code and examples
		can be found at https://ulog.udl.cat/static/doc/epidemic-gga/html/index.html.
