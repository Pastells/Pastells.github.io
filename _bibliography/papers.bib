  abstract={This paper presents an overview of the DETESTS-Dis shared task as part of the IberLEF 2024 Workshop on Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum, within the framework of the SEPLN 2024 conference. We proposed two hierarchical subtasks: In subtask 1, participants had to determine the presence of stereotypes in the texts. For subtask 2, participants had to decide which texts labeled with stereotypes were implicit stereotypes. The DETESTS-Dis dataset contains 12,111 comment sentences and tweets in response to newspaper articles and verified racial hoaxes involving immigration in Spanish. 15 teams signed up to participate, 6 of which sent runs, and 3 of them sent their working notes. In this paper, we provide information about the training and test datasets, the systems used by the participants, the evaluation metrics of the systems and their results.},

  title={Context-Aware Stereotype Detection: Conversational Thread Analysis on BERT-based Models},

  year={2024},
  journal={CEUR Proceedings SEPLN},
  abstract={Conversational context plays a pivotal role in disambiguating messages in human communication. In this study, we investigate the impact of contextual information on detecting stereotypes related to immigrants using various BERT-based models. We use two Spanish corpora containing news comments and tweets, together with their conversational threads, annotated with stereotypes related to immigrants in Spain. The results show that the influence of context on stereotype detection varies across different models, corpora and context levels. Although context can enhance performance in specific scenarios, it does not consistently improve stereotype detection across all the levels of contexts. Our comprehensive evaluation underscores the complex relationship between context and stereotype identification when we use BERT-based Language Models. In particular, we found that the number of texts benefiting from contextual analysis may be too limited for the models to effectively learn from.},

		The increasing popularity of natural language processing has led to a race to
		improve machine learning models that often leaves aside the core study
		object, the language itself. In this study, we present classification models
		designed to detect stereotypes related to immigrants, along with both
		quantitative and qualitative analyses, shedding light on linguistic
		distinctions in how humans and various models perceive stereotypes. Given the
		subjective nature of this task, one of the models incorporates the judgments
		of all annotators by utilizing soft labels. Through a comparative analysis of
		BERT-based models using both hard and soft labels, along with predictions
		from GPT-4, we gain a clearer understanding of the linguistic challenges
		posed by texts containing stereotypes. Our dataset comprises Spanish Twitter
		posts collected as responses to immigrant-related hoaxes, annotated with
		binary values indicating the presence of stereotypes, implicitness, and the
		requirement for conversational context to understand the stereotype. Our
		findings suggest that both model prediction confidence and inter-annotator
		agreement are higher for explicit stereotypes, while stereotypes conveyed
		through irony and other figures of speech prove more challenging to detect
		than other implicit stereotypes.

		Alfvénic activity has been observed in the TJ-II stellarator which resembles
		the frequency sweeping demonstrated by Alfvén cascade modes in tokamaks. A
		numerical validation study was conducted using a reduced magnetohydrodynamic
		(MHD) model to show that such modes could only have been observed in
		discharges where the rotational transform profile was non-monotonic. During
		experiments, coil current was varied which resulted in shifting of the
		minimum value of the rotational transform profile. To mimic this effect, we
		study the Alfvénic activity predicted by the reduced MHD model for a set of
		input rotational transform profiles with varying minima. A mode is found
		whose toroidal and poloidal mode numbers match those predicted in experiments
		which sweeps downward/upward in frequency as the minimum value of the
		rotational transform profile is increased/decreased. The results serve as a
		demonstration of the validity and utility of MHD spectroscopy.

		Many epidemiological models and algorithms are used to fit the parameters of
		a given epidemic curve. On many occasions, fitting algorithms are interleaved
		with the actual epidemic models, which yields combinations of
		model-parameters that are hard to compare among themselves. Here, we provide
		a model-agnostic framework for epidemic parameter fitting that can (fairly)
		compare different epidemic models without jeopardizing the quality of the
		fitted parameters. Briefly, we have developed a Python framework that expects
		a Python function (epidemic model) and epidemic data and performs parameter
		fitting using automatic configuration. Our framework is capable of fitting
		parameters for any type of epidemic model, as long as it is provided as a
		Python function (or even in a different programming language). Moreover, we
		provide the code for different types of models, as well as the implementation
		of 4 concrete models with data to fit them. Documentation, code and examples
		can be found at https://ulog.udl.cat/static/doc/epidemic-gga/html/index.html.
